# Sample Restaurant Page

A sample page for a made-up restaurant following [The Odin Project JavaScript course](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/tic-tac-toe-javascript).

The focus of this exercise was to practice the logic behind the navigation tabs. That is why other aspects like content or responsiveness were not fully addressed.
